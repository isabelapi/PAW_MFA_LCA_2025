# PAW: Prospective Assessment of waste water treatment
PAW is a prospective Life Cycle Assessment (pLCA) and Material Flow Analysis (MFA) model created as part of the Depart de Sentier (DdS) Autumn School 2025.

###  System Boundaries
- Functional Unit = 1 m3 water treated in Germany
- Time 2020 - 2035 - 2045 (related to UWWTD years)
- Geography = Germany
- Scope: Excluding Infrastructure impacts from LCA
### Impact Factors
- USEtox (freshwater ecotoxicity)
	- to soil
	- to water
- GWP

# Assumptions to simplify

- [x] Assume: Removal Rate of technologies does not change with inflow concentration
- [x] only 1 average CEC toxicity is evaluated - USEtox average into biosphere database
- [x] Assume: Energy consumption of technologies does not change with inflow concentration

# Dimensions

r - country == germany
s - scenarios (cornerstones??)
	- 1. high environmental policy
	- 2. low ...
y - years (2020 / 2035 / 2045)
c - type of carrier (sludge , Water, oxidized contaminants)
x - substance (water, sludge, contaminant)
